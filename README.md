# Perl

The focus of this is knowing the minimum possible to be able to do one liners, specially in text processing.

For larger programs, use Python instead, because Perl is too insane and is dead.

Perl is part of the LSB, and should come with any Linux distro (like Python).

The following contains lots of man pages and HTML docs:

	man perlrun
	man perldoc
	man perlcheat

In Ubuntu install docs with:

    sudo aptitude install -y perl-doc
